Step 1: Restate the Problem (Foundation Prompts)
Initial Prompt
I need to create a weather dashboard in Python that uses a provided module to access weather data and displays it in a user-friendly interface. Can you help me restate this problem more clearly to ensure I understand all requirements?

🤖 AI Response (partial)
This problem involves creating a Python application that:
1.Retrieves weather data from a provided module or API
2.Processes that data properly
3.Presents the information in a clear, user-friendly interface
4.Allows users to interact with it to view different weather metrics
Main components include:
1.Functions to retrieve and process data
2.Display system for showing results
3.User interaction for navigation and options
4.Visualisation (charts or icons)

🗣️ Follow-up Prompt
That’s helpful. Could you explain what kinds of weather data are usually available from APIs and which visualisations are most useful?

🤖 AI Response (partial)
Typical weather data:
1.Temperature, humidity, wind, and precipitation
2.UV index, air pressure, visibility
3.Current conditions and multi-day forecasts
Recommended visuals:
1.Line charts for temperature trends
2.Bar charts for high/low comparisons
3.Gauge charts for humidity or UV
4.Icons for conditions (rainy, cloudy, etc.)

Step 2: Identify Input/Output Requirements

🗣️ Prompt
Based on our discussion, these are my inputs and outputs.
Inputs:
City name or location
Forecast period (1–5 days)
Outputs:
Current conditions
Daily forecast summaries
Any error messages

🤖 AI Response
That’s correct. You may also want to include user preferences (°C/°F) and refresh options.

Step 3: Work Problem by Hand

🗣️ Prompt
Let’s think through the logic manually:
1.Get the city name from the user
2.Validate input
3.Retrieve data from the web API
4.Group forecasts by date
5.Summarise each day’s weather
6.Extract the current day’s conditions
7.Return everything neatly in a dictionary

🤖 AI Response
That’s a clear plan. Add basic error handling and limit forecasts to five days.

Step 4: Request Pseudocode

🗣️ Prompt
Can you show how to represent that logic in pseudocode?

🤖 AI Response

function get_weather_data(city, forecast_days):
    if invalid city:
        return error
    call Get_data_from_Web(city)
    if response has list:
        group by day
        summarise forecast
        extract current
        return result dictionary
    else:
        return error message

🗣️ Follow-up Prompt
Looks good. I’ll implement this with proper validation and data grouping.

Step 5: Convert to Python Code

🗣️ Prompt
Let’s turn this into real Python code that works with my WeatherWise data pipeline.
The function should validate inputs, group data by date, and extract both forecast and current weather information.

🤖 AI Response (draft)
The assistant provided a basic draft structure, which I then refined through testing and iterative prompting to handle missing data and API errors gracefully.

Step 6: Final Implementation and Testing

After several iterations, this was my final version of the function integrated into WeatherWise.

def get_weather_data(city: str, forecast_days: int = 5):
    """
    Retrieve weather data for a specified location.

    Args:
        location (str): City or location name
        forecast_days (int): Number of days to forecast (1-5)

    Returns:
        dict: Weather data including current conditions and forecast
    """
    result: ParsedWeather = {
        "location": city,
        "forecast_days": max(1, min(int(forecast_days or 5), 5)),
    }

    # Validate the city input: must be a non-empty string
    if not city or not isinstance(city, str):
        result["error"] = "Invalid location provided. Please enter a city name."
        return result

    response_data = Get_data_from_Web(city=city, units="metric")

    if response_data and "list" in response_data:
        daily_forecasts: List[Dict[str, Any]] = []

        # Group data by day
        daily_data: Dict[str, List[Dict[str, Any]]] = {}
        for item in response_data["list"]:
            date_str = item["dt_txt"].split(" ")[0]
            if date_str not in daily_data:
                daily_data[date_str] = []
            daily_data[date_str].append(item)

        # Determine the dates to include in the forecast based on forecast_days
        from datetime import datetime, timedelta
        today = datetime.now().date()
        dates_to_include = [
            (today + timedelta(days=i)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
            for i in range(result["forecast_days"])
        ]

        # Process data for each included date using the helper function
        for date_str in dates_to_include:
            if date_str in daily_data:
                day_items = daily_data[date_str]
                daily_summary = _process_daily_forecast_items(day_items, date_str)
                if daily_summary:
                    daily_forecasts.append(daily_summary)

        result["daily"] = daily_forecasts

        # Extract first entry as "current" weather if for today
        if response_data["list"]:
            first_item = response_data["list"][0]
            if first_item["dt_txt"].split(" ")[0] == today.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"):
                result["current"] = {
                    "temp_C": first_item["main"]["temp"],
                    "FeelsLike": first_item["main"]["feels_like"],
                    "weatherDescript": first_item["weather"],
                    "precipi_MM": first_item.get("rain", {}).get("3h", 0),
                    "wind_speed": first_item["wind"]["speed"] * 3.6,
                    "wind_degrees": None
                }

    elif response_data and response_data.get("error"):
        result["error"] = response_data["error"]
    else:
        result["error"] = "Missed to recover the weather forecast data."

return result

✅ Testing summary:

Valid city → complete data

Invalid city → clear error message

Network failure → handled gracefully

Missing data → safely ignored or defaulted

Before / After — Integration with AI Language Output

Date: 2025-10-18

Before (Conversation Extract)

Me:
Now that my WeatherWise system can fetch and process data, I want to generate natural language answers automatically. I already have parse_weather_question() to interpret user input and get_weather_data() to retrieve information. How can I make a function that combines these and lets the AI generate a natural sentence?

AI:
You need a function that accepts both the parsed question and the weather data, creates a weather context string, combines it with the question, sends it to the AI model using get_response(), and returns a generated answer.

Me:
How should I format the weather context?

AI:
You can structure it like this:

weather_context = f"Weather data for {location}:\n"
if current:
    weather_context += f"Current conditions: Temperature {current.get('temp_C')}°C..."
if daily:
    for day in daily:
        weather_context += f"{day.get('date')}: Max {day.get('maxtemperature')}°C..."


Me:
Okay, here’s my first draft:

def generate_weather_response(parsed_question, weather_data):
    ...


AI:
Excellent — it’s modular, readable, and error-resistant. You can now test it by combining it with get_weather_data().

After (Final Integration Result)

When I combined both get_weather_data() and generate_weather_response(), the AI was able to create full-sentence weather explanations automatically, such as:

“It looks like light showers are expected tomorrow in Perth, with a maximum temperature of 21°C.”

This integration demonstrated end-to-end AI collaboration — from parsing a question to retrieving data and finally generating natural language output.
